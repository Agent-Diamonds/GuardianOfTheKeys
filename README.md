# Guardian of the Keys

## Introduction
Welcome to **Guardian of the Keys**. This project is WIP. It is intended to be a robust and secure password manager and generator. Designed with your digital security in mind, Guardian of the Keys ensures your passwords are not only strong but also securely stored locally and encrypted. Our mission is to provide you with a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience in managing your digital credentials.

## Features (WIP)
- **Local and Encrypted Storage**: Your passwords are stored locally on your device, with robust encryption for maximum security.
- **Password Generator**: Generate strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts, reducing the risk of security breaches.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, intuitive interface makes it easy to manage your passwords effectively.
- **Secure Access**: Your vault is only accessible through a master password, ensuring only you can access your credentials.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: (Future Feature) Import passwords to other devices using a P2P over SSL connection.

## Installation
TBD. Project is WIP.

## Future Explorations
- **P2P over SSL Connection**: We are exploring the potential of using a peer-to-peer connection secured with SSL to enable seamless password importing between devices.
